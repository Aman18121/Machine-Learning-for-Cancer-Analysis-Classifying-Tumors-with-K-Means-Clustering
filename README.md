**Project Overview**
Hi, I am Aman Yadav, a Masterâ€™s student in Life Science Informatics at the Technical University of Deggendorf, Germany. I worked on this project independently as a personal interest, separate from my university coursework.

This project demonstrates the use of the K-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to classify cancerous cells as benign or malignant based on specific cell features like size and texture. The main objective was to utilize clustering to effectively distinguish between the two types of tumors, showcasing a practical application of machine learning in medical diagnostics and cancer research.

**Dataset**
For this project, I used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data). The dataset includes detailed measurements of cell nuclei obtained from breast cancer biopsies. These measurements provide critical information about various aspects of cell morphology, which are essential for studying cancer detection and diagnosis. Originally collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, the dataset is a valuable resource for applying machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the characteristics of breast cancer.

**Methodology**
The K-means clustering algorithm was applied to group cancer cells based on the morphological features of their nuclei. The Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which was found to be two. This clustering effectively separates the data into two groups, representing benign and malignant tumors. This approach illustrates how unsupervised learning can reveal hidden patterns in data, emphasizing the potential of clustering techniques for early detection and classification of cancer.

**Conclusion**
The findings from this project highlight the significant role of machine learning in the field of medicine, particularly in oncology, where accurately differentiating between types of tumors is critical for diagnosis and treatment. By clustering cancer cells based on key features, this project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of malignant and benign tumors. It demonstrates the usefulness of the K-means algorithm in advancing cancer research and improving diagnostic precision.
