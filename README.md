# Machine-Learning-for-Cancer-Analysis-Classifying-Tumors-with-K-Means-Clustering
This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to classify cancerous cells as benign or malignant based on features like size and texture. By optimizing the number of clusteThe model effectively distinguishes between the two types of tumors, aiding in cancer diagnosis and research.
